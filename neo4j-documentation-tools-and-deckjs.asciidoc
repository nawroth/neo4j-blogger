== Neo4j Documentation Tools and Deck.js ==

This is yet one more of my experiments expanding the use of the Neo4j documentation toolchain into new areas.

The idea in this case is to have a simple file containing one or more Cypher queries.
The tools will take care of executing the queries, and write different useful files in AsciiDoc format.
These files can then easily be include when writing slides using AsciiDoc to produce deck.js slides.

For example there's a live console generated based on the query, just include it, and you can have a live console in a slide, which can look like so:

Demo slides are found here: http://docs.neo4j.org/lab/deck/

The project itself is found here: https://github.com/nawroth/neo4j-deckjs

Before executing it you will need to do `mvn install` on this project:

In case Maven doesn't download it for you, the Neo4j documentation tools are found here:
